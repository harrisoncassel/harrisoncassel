### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

**Statistics undergraduate (May 2024) @ the University of South Carolina**

**Actuarial Executive Development Program Intern @ The Cigna Group (Denver, CO - Summer 2023)**                                                                     

My undergraduate thesis research focuses on (and is largely comprised of) my [wbb-markov](https://github.com/harrisoncassel/wbb-markov) repository. I am investigating the efficacy of the discrete Markov Chain as a model for NCAA DI Women's Basketball games/teams.
